Command prompt game from original idea.
Run game via Hovedprogram.java

:::::::
PRO TIP: Run game for a few seconds, then cancel. 
You probably need to adjust width of command prompt to align obstacles in vertical lines.
Like this:

I <br>
I <br>
I <br>
I <br>
I <br>
I <br>
I <br>

Now run game again, and use enter key to fly and avoid obstacles.
